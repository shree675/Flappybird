# Flappybird

## About
<p>Flappybird is a game in which the player controls a bird attempting to fly between columns of pipes without hitting them. The rules are the same as the original Flappybird game.</p>

<p>This is a simple version of flappybird developed by me during my days of learning python. And this has been developed only using python.</p>
